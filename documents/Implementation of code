#What fraction of your code is documented (and which style did you use)? (1 point) 
Core parts of the connection establishments code is commented. We decided to document the code by comments since the code part itself is not that huge and it is easier to follow with minimal documentation within the code. 

#How detailed is your README file or the instructions to configure and run your project? Can another team demonstrate your project using the instructions? (1 point) 
Further documentation is given in the readme file, such as general information about the project and how to set it up. The readme file has step by step instructions on how to get the project, how to set it up on your local machine and how to use it, so by reading those things another team can easily demonstrate our project. 

#Which license did you use, why? Is the license compatible with the open-source tools you have used? (0.5 points) 
We are using MIT license and it is compatible with the main library that we are using, Django Daphne. Daphne uses BSD 3-Clause license, which means that the library can be freely used in commercial and private use such that the copyright is preserved. 

#What fraction of the modules are working?  Have you documented the challenges with the code? (2.5 points) 
All the modules are working, and we were able to make successful video calls with audio. Our main modules functions are user authentication and authorization and making a videocall. From the start we knew that our goal was to make a very basic videocall application without any mute or other similar additional functions to the application. In the end we tackled all the challenges we faced, so there was nothing to document on that part.
